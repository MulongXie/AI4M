Here, a member sending an invitation to connect with a suggested candidate can be viewed as a positive outcome. We apply our methodology to (proprietary) training data used for such a product containing historical recommendations and labels indicating whether an invitation has been sent. Members are categorized as infrequent members (IMs; members who are less active on the platform) or frequent members (FMs) who tend to have greater rates of engagement and correspondingly higher representation in the training data. In this example there is potential for the model to not only be biased against IMs, but for that bias to be reinforced over time, leading to a system that is optimized for the benefit of members who are already highly engaged on the site (also known as “popularity bias” or the “rich getting richer” phenomenon [1]). We see an opportunity to apply fairness notions, as a debiasing mechanism, to adjust for the exposure of IMs as candidates being recommended, thus giving them opportunities to be shown and invited. In our experiments, we applied both the EOpp and EOdds reranker to give qualified IMs and FMs equal representation in recommendations. We build the required transformations using two weeks of training data. While serving we apply the transformation on the top 100 candidates. The serving was done via a discretized CDF (with 10000 points) for EOpp and through the estimated transition probabilities (based on 100 bins) for EOdds. Due to the simple transformation in both approaches, we did not see any drastic gain in latency, which is a core-requirement in large-scale recommender systems. The results of the A/B tests on real member traffic are shown in Table 1. What is the potential negative impact?\"]},{\"user\":\"Expertise\",\"message\":[\" \\n\\nThe main potential negative impact of implementing friend or connection recommendation systems is the potential for propagate and/or reinforce existing bias. This can occur in the data sets used to train the system, as well as in how the system makes recommendations. For example, if particular groups are underrepresented in the data, or if the system disproportionately favors certain groups due to existing patterns in its data, the system could unwittingly promote and reinforce existing systemic bias. Additionally, the system could be vulnerable to manipulation, for example, if malicious actors use it to unfairly target or exclude members from certain categories.\"]}]}"
